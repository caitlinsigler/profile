## Welcome to my Profile!

My name is Caitlin Sigler. I am currently a student at Santa Clara University, studying computer science, environmental studies, and sustainability. 

### Recent Projects
The most recent project I have worked on is an [automated hydroponics system](https://). 

I have also worked on a simple [website](https://bonniesbees.netlify.com/index.html) for my friend Ryan, who runs his own honey company from the beehives in his backayrd.

A group software project that I worked on with a team of other SCU students, known as [Uadopt](https://uadopt.netlify.com), is a website that uses AI to match a user with their perfect pet. I took a lead role on the layout and design of the website, and also developed the matching algorithm. My original C++ code can be found [here](https://github.com/caitlinsigler/SCUProjects/blob/master/C/AlgorithmTesting.cpp), but you can see it in action [here](https://github.com/NickPriv/Uadopt/blob/master/topFiveBreeds.php).
