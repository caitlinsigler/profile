### Recent Projects
#### Automated Hydroponic System
The most recent project I have worked on is an [automated hydroponics system](https://). This system integrates Particle Photon and a pH sensor, using IoT to deliver important messages to the user over Slack if any sensor measurements are found to be suboptimal for growing.

#### Bonnie's Bees
I have also worked on a simple [website](https://bonniesbees.netlify.com/index.html) for my friend Ryan, who runs his own honey company from the beehives in his backayrd.

#### Uadopt
A group software project that I worked on with a team of other SCU students, known as [Uadopt](https://uadopt.netlify.com), is a website that uses AI to match a user with their perfect pet. I took a lead role on the layout and design of the website, and also developed the matching algorithm. My original C++ code can be found [here](https://github.com/caitlinsigler/SCUProjects/blob/master/C/AlgorithmTesting.cpp), but you can see it in action [here](https://github.com/NickPriv/Uadopt/blob/master/topFiveBreeds.php).
